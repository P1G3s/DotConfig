## WhAt aRe ThEsE???

  Greetings sir, these are some of my **Config Files** on linux OS, and they are basically the backup in case i borke the system or hop to another distro. Since i am a noob, **i can't promise that these files are in good quality**, but if you are interested, please feel free to try it and post any problems you might have so that i can make things better. Anyways, here are some screenshots of my ricing( i'm a fan of _**retro**_ things, so there might be tons of wierd stuffs), it's Pixel Time :D

## Scripts
  I try writing some very basic scripts with my limited shell knowledge, just for convenience :P
- **chsrc**                    :helps me change the apt source file when i'm not experiencing hyperspeed downloading
- **chbkg**                    :helps me change wallpaper more easily, i have it bound to the key "bg" in ranger so that i can change wallpaper right in the ranger (just simply type bg with the selected image in ranger)
